## **Overview of Citibike Analysis**

This was a Tableau analysis of Citibike's August 2019 customers in New York City. Some of the data retrieved from from Citibike included trip durations, the start and endtime of trips, where they started at and went to, and more information on the customer profile. This data was looked at with the hope that it could be used to start the same profitable business in Des Moines, Iowa.

A Tableau story was created [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeSharingChallenge_16784298801820/NYCCitibike?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link "link to dashboard") to help visualize the numbers in NYC.
