## **Overview of Citibike Analysis**

This was a Tableau analysis of Citibike's August 2019 customers in New York City. Some of the data retrieved from Citibike included trip durations, the start and endtime of trips, where they started at and went to, and more information on the customer profile. This data was looked at with the hope that it could be used to start the same profitable business in Des Moines, Iowa.

A Tableau story was created [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/J5K25R5BS?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link "link to dashboard") to help visualize the numbers in NYC.

## **Summary**

In looking at all of the data analyzed, we can pull a few main points out to focus on in trying to advertise the program to Des Moines.
- More people pay for a subscription than one time rides.
- Most customers are male (65%).
- The heaviest use times are generally M-F, around 8am and 5-6pm. This could corrorlate to morning and afternoon commutes to and from work.
- Most rides across all genders are only about 10 minutes long, with almost all rides being less than an hour long.

Most of the data points to male subscribers being the biggest profit group, so one of the visualizations that would provide more insight would be a breakdown of users ages. This could help narrow the main profit group from only males to males, ages 20-40, for example. This particular data would need to be cleaned as some of the ages go as far back as 1885! Another visualization that could be explored is the average distances traveled, and to show that on a map. This could help give an idea of how big of an area Citibike needs to cover in Des Moines. If most bike rides happen in only a few square blocks, Citibike can focus their resources more in that area rather than stretch themselves thin.
